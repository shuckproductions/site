**Shuck Productions**, based in the North West of England. We strive to create quality products from short films to promotional videos.

The company was founded by Jordan Shuck, a filmmaker/actor from Blackpool. Find more information about Jordan [here](http://jordan.shuck.org.uk).

Our creative team work together on many different productions from fact to fiction. We aim to tell the story of each sequence and deliver the important message to the audience.

We work closely with <a href="http://www.blackpoolscouts.org.uk" target="_blank"> Blackpool Scouts </a>, creating their events videos and promotional material, to show their everyday advewnture they provide young people. You can view our work for them on their Youtube channel.
